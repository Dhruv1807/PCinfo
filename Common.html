<h1>Commonly asked Questions</h1>
<h2>01. My computer isn’t working. What do I do?</h2>
<h3>Whether it’s your whole computer, a single program, your email, or the internet, sometimes things just don’t work. That’s exactly when you should call IT support
</h3>
<h2>02. Why is my computer so slow?</h2>
<h3>Does your computer take forever to start up or open programs? Or just seem sluggish throughout the day? There are many reasons why your computer might be running slow.
</h3>
<h2>03. How can I do things faster?</h2>
<h3>Speaking of speed, if you’ve ever watched a tech-whiz on a computer, sometimes it seems like they’re doing magic with how quickly things fly around the screen. In reality, they’re probably using keyboard shortcuts.
</h3>

<h2>04. I lost a file on my computer. Where did it go?</h2>
<h3>Finding a missing document or app may take a little detective work, but your computer has a lot of tools to help.

First, check your Recycle Bin to see if you accidentally deleted a file. If not, check if you saved the file in a different place. In general, having well-organized files & folders will help you find things more quickly and easily.
</h3>

<h2>05. Why do I need to back up my computer?</h2>
<h3>Sometimes you really do lose files, and they’re gone forever if you don’t back up your computer.

You may lose data at any time due to a hardware failure, a natural disaster, a virus or ransomware attack, or human error.

If you want to protect your critical business files and avoid a data disaster, invest in a reliable data backup and recovery service.
</h3>

<h2>06. How can I tell if I have a virus?</h2>
<h3>There are many ways to tell if your computer has a virus. Ideally, you’ll have a good antivirus program installed that will catch the virus and alert you before it causes any damage.

If a virus or malware infects your computer, chances are you’ll see the symptoms like annoying pop-ups, error messages, programs crashing, or things just running really slow. Use your antivirus software to run a scan, or ask your IT company for help to remove the virus.
</h3>

<h2>07. How do I avoid getting hacked?</h2>
<h3>Getting hacked isn’t a matter of IF, but WHEN. Cybercrime is on the rise, and, unfortunately, there’s no 100% foolproof way to stop hackers. The real problem for most small businesses is that they don’t even know when they’ve been attacked.

The best way to protect your business is to implement cybersecurity measures like antivirus protection, network monitoring, and stolen password detection. Our team at EZComputer Solutions would be happy to talk to you about cybersecurity solutions for your small business.

<h2>08. Why shouldn’t I use free WiFi?</h2>
<h3>You may have heard that you shouldn’t use public WiFi networks, like in coffee shops, hotels, or airports. While they’re free and convenient, these networks aren’t secure, which means hackers can intercept everything you’re doing over the internet.
</h3>

<h2>09. What is “the cloud?”</h2>
<h3>The cloud and cloud computing refer to data and services that run over the internet, instead of your local computer. Technically, the cloud is a network of servers around the globe. Practically, it means you can access software and services from any device, as long as it has an internet connection.
